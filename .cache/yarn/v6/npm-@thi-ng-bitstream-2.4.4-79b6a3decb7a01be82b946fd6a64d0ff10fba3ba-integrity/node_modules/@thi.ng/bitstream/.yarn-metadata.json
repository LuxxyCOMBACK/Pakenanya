Individual word sizes can range between 1-52 bits (in practice)\nand are not fixed (each word can have a different size).\n\nThe constructor accepts an optional initial `Uint8Array` buffer or\nbuffer size (in bytes) and an optional write start position (**in\nbits**). The buffer will only be written to starting from the given bit\nposition (even if in the middle of a byte). Default buffer size is 16\nbytes, but the array is resized (x2) automatically each time capacity is\nreached.\n\n**Note**: The max. word size of 52 bits is not enforced by the library,\nbut JS can only represent integers (w/o loss of precision) up to\n`2^53-1`. If you're willing to accept lossy precision for larger values,\ntechnically the max. supported word width is 64 bits.\n\n```ts\nimport { BitOutputStream } from \"@thi.ng/bitstream\";\n\nout = new BitOutputStream();\n// write 3-bit number (only the lowest 3 bits are used, here 0x05)\nout.write(0xf5, 3);\n// write 7-bit number\nout.write(0x66, 7);\n// write 32-bit number\nout.write(0xdecafbad, 32);\n\n// write values from given iterable (w/ fixed word size, here 16 bits)\nout.writeWords([0xaaaa, 0x5555], 16);\n\n// get bytes (only up to current write position)\nout.bytes()\n// Uint8Array [ 185, 183, 178, 190, 235, 106, 170, 149, 85, 64 ]\n```\n\nIn addition to the generic `write()` method, there's also the slightly\nfaster `writeBit()` for writing single bits (the arg MUST be `0` or `1`\nonly).\n\nUsing `seek(pos)`, the write position can be repositioned within current\nlimits (does not attempt to resize backing buffer).\n\n### BitInputStream\n\n`Uint8Array` backed bitwise input stream abstraction (big endian order)\nwith optional start position and read limit (both **in bits**). All\nreaders are independent instances, but if obtained from\n`BitOutputStream` will share the same backing buffer as the writer. An\nauto-configured input stream can also be obtained via `output.reader()`.\nThe class too implements the ES6 Iterator API for **bitwise** read\naccess, as well as a `read()` method to read bitfields.\n\n**Note**: By default, attempting to read beyond capacity will throw an EOF\nerror. However, all available read methods in `BitInputStream` support an\noptional argument to disable bounds checking (by passing `false` as extra arg).\nThese unsafe reads will result in undefined behavior once read past EOF ‚Äî¬†use\nwith caution!\n\nUsing `input.seek(pos)`, the read position can be repositioned within\nstream limits.\n\n```ts\n// get input from output stream (see above)...\n// (for reference, the ^ indicate the start of each bit field)\n[...out.reader()].join(\"\")\n// \"10111001101101111011001010111110111010110110101010101010100101010101010101\"\n//  ^  ^      ^                               ^               ^\n\n// obtain new reader\ninput = out.reader();\n// sequentially read bit fields of varying sizes\nout.reader().readFields([3, 7, 32, 16, 16]).map(x => x.toString(16))\n// [ \"5\", \"66\", \"decafbad\", \"aaaa\", \"5555\" ]\n\n// or read fields into object\nout.reader().readStruct([[\"a\", 3], [\"b\", 7], [\"c\", 32], [\"d\", 16], [\"e\", 16]]);\n// { a: 5, b: 102, c: 3737844653, d: 43690, e: 21845 }\n\n// or read a number of fixed size words (here also from given pos)\nout.reader().seek(10).readWords(4, 16).map(x=>x.toString(16));\n// [ 'deca', 'fbad', 'aaaa', '5555' ]\n\nimport { BitInputStream } from \"@thi.ng/bitstream\";\n\nsrc = new Uint8Array([0xf1,0xe2,0xd3,0xc4,0xb5,0xa6,0x97,0x88]);\n// create stream from bit 36\ninput = new BitInputStream(src, 36);\ninput.read(12).toString(16);\n// 5a6\ninput.read(4)\n// 9\ninput.read(4)\n// 7\ninput.read(1) // or use input.readBit()\n// 1 => msb of last byte (0x88)\ninput.read(7)\n// 8 => low nibble of last byte\n```\n\nIn addition to the generic `read()` method, there's also the slightly\nfaster `readBit()` for reading single bits.\n\n### Barebones alternatives\n\nFor use cases requiring only word sizes <=8 bits and none of the advanced features provided by the above implementations, the package also provides functional barebones alternatives in the form of [`bitWriter()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/bitstream/functions/bitWriter.html) and [`bitReader()`](https://docs.thi.ng/umbrella/bitstream/functions/bitReader.html):\n\n```ts\nimport { bitReader, bitWriter } from \"@thi.ng/bistream\";\n\nconst writer = bitWriter();\n// write single bit\nwriter.write(1);\n\n// write unsigned value (up to 8 bits)\nwriter.write(31, 5);\n\n// retrieve buffer\nconst bytes = writer.bytes();\n// Uint8Array(1) [ 252 ]\n\n// create reader from byte buffer\nconst reader = bitReader(bytes);\n\n// read single bit\nreader();\n// 1\n\n// read n-bit unsigned value\nreader(5);\n// 31\n```\n\n## Authors\n\n- [Karsten Schmidt](https://thi.ng)\n\nIf this project contributes to an academic publication, please cite it as:\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{thing-bitstream,\n  title = \"@thi.ng/bitstream\",\n  author = \"Karsten Schmidt\",\n  note = \"https://thi.ng/bitstream\",\n  year = 2016\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\n&copy; 2016 - 2024 Karsten Schmidt // Apache License 2.0\n",
