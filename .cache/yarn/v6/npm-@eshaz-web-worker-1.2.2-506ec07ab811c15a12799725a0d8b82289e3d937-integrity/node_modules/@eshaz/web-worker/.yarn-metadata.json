Works in published npm modules.\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105127/79602228-1998bf00-80b8-11ea-91e4-26b212aabaa2.png\" width=\"1000\" alt=\"\">\n</p>\n\n**In Node**, it's a web-compatible Worker implementation atop Node's [worker_threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html).\n\n**In the browser** (and when bundled for the browser), it's simply an alias of `Worker`.\n\n### Features\n\n_Here's how this is different from worker_threads:_\n\n- makes Worker code compatible across browser and Node\n- supports Module Workers (`{type:'module'}`) natively in Node 12.8+\n- uses DOM-style events (`Event.data`, `Event.type`, etc)\n- supports event handler properties (`worker.onmessage=..`)\n- `Worker()` accepts a module URL, Blob URL or Data URL\n- emulates browser-style [WorkerGlobalScope] within the worker\n\n### Usage Example\n\nIn its simplest form:\n\n```js\nimport Worker from 'web-worker';\n\nconst worker = new Worker('data:,postMessage(\"hello\")');\nworker.onmessage = e => console.log(e.data);  // \"hello\"\n```\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th><strong>main.js</strong></th><th><strong>worker.js</strong></th></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr><td>\n\n```js\nimport Worker from 'web-worker';\n\nconst url = new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url);\nconst worker = new Worker(url);\n\nworker.addEventListener('message', e => {\n  console.log(e.data)  // \"hiya!\"\n});\n\nworker.postMessage('hello');\n```\n\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n\n```js\naddEventListener('message', e => {\n  if (e.data === 'hello') {\n    postMessage('hiya!');\n  }\n});\n```\n\n</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n\nðŸ‘‰ Notice how `new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url)` is used above to load the worker relative to the current module instead of the application base URL. Without this, Worker URLs are relative to a document's URL, which in Node.js is interpreted to be `process.cwd()`.\n\n> _Support for this pattern in build tools and test frameworks is still limited. We are [working on growing this](https://github.com/developit/web-worker/issues/4)._\n\n### Module Workers\n\nModule Workers are supported in Node 12.8+ using this plugin, leveraging Node's native ES Modules support.\nIn the browser, they can be used natively in Chrome 80+, or in all browsers via [worker-plugin] or [rollup-plugin-off-main-thread]. As with classic workers, there is no difference in usage between Node and the browser:\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th><strong>main.mjs</strong></th><th><strong>worker.mjs</strong></th></tr></thead>\n<tbody><tr><td>\n\n```js\nimport Worker from 'web-worker';\n\nconst worker = new Worker(\n  new URL('./worker.mjs', import.meta.url),\n  { type: 'module' }\n);\nworker.addEventListener('message', e => {\n  console.log(e.data)  // \"200 OK\"\n});\nworker.postMessage('https://httpstat.us/200');\n```\n\n</td><td valign=\"top\">\n\n```js\nimport fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';\n\naddEventListener('message', async e => {\n  const url = e.data;\n  const res = await fetch(url)\n  const text = await res.text();\n  postMessage(text);\n});\n```\n\n</td></tr></tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n### Data URLs\n\nInstantiating Worker using a Data URL is supported in both module and classic workers:\n\n```js\nimport Worker from 'web-worker';\n\nconst worker = new Worker(`data:application/javascript,postMessage(42)`);\nworker.addEventListener('message', e => {\n  console.log(e.data)  // 42\n});\n```\n\n### Special Thanks\n\nThis module aims to provide a simple and forgettable piece of infrastructure,\nand as such it needed an obvious and descriptive name.\n[@calvinmetcalf](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf), who you may recognize as the author of [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) and other fine modules, gratiously offered up the name from his `web-worker` package.\nThanks Calvin!\n\n\n[worker-plugin]: https://github.com/googlechromelabs/worker-plugin\n[rollup-plugin-off-main-thread]: https://github.com/surma/rollup-plugin-off-main-thread\n[WorkerGlobalScope]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope\n",
